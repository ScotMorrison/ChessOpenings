Chess Openings Analysis

This is a small program for analysing win rates of various moves played in provided chess games.
The program will take a standardised chess match list document, parse it, then allow the user to
explore the structure while providing win rate information.

Instructions:
- Download a match history .pgn file from lichess.org.
- Rename it to history.txt and drop it in the main folder.
- Change the "name" variable in the header of the code to match the username of the player you
  wish to collect data on.
- Run main.
